# Week Challenges

## Tuesday 19 July, 2022

1. [✅] Base on this reading and this video, create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages in your README.
  Interpreted and Compiled Programming Languages.
  
  Overall Explanation: Programs need to be run by general CPU hardwares.
  Depending on the main target or function of a software or application, we might choose between 3 archetypes of programming languages for working in their development or testing:
  1. Compiling the source code: These are the files and codes that do not move easily from one computer device to another to work on it.
    Program examples: C, C++, Objective-C.
  2. Interpreting code: These are the files and codes that do move more freely from device to device to work on them.
    Examples are: PHP, JavasScript.
  3. Just in time or Jit Compilation: Is when the files of the coding achieve the longest expansion between several 'flexible' devices.
  Examples of Hybrid programs: Java, C#, VB.NET, Python.
  
2. [✅] Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?, check the sources and answer the question in your README.
    Answer: It's an hybrid so it's possible to be run by a hardware CPU.
    Mainly, it turns the
    - Machine language: binary code (compiled languages)
    into
    - Human language: Coding and programming (assembly language).
    Bytecode: abstract code, that machine language reads. Is treated like a binary file. 
  Are there any software examples of these archetypes?
