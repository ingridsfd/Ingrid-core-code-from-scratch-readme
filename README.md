# Description
This is the repository I use as a notebook. This also helps me practice Markdown format.

There is a new folder added "MoreSimpleExercises". In this folder we can find parallel exercises to the ones I'm learning at CoreCode so I can have a better grasp of the concepts we are learning simultaneously. These exercises are referenced from CodeCademy.

# My mission statement:
I am Ingrid.
