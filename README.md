# Description
This is the repository I use as a notebook. This also helps me practice Markdown format.

There is a new folder added "MoreSimpleExercises". In this folder we can find parallel exercises to the ones I'm learning at CoreCode so I can have a better grasp of the concepts we are learning simultaneously. These exercises are referenced from CodeCademy.

# My mission statement:
I am Ingrid, a web software developer. I come from a background in humanities and politics. However, my first project involving technology was at Diplomacia Activa creating content in Social Media and WordPress. I also did a little of graphic design basics. During my experience at Diplomacia Activa, I encountered this fascination for Web Development that would motivate me to enroll in CoreCode “Software Development Fundamentals” bootcamp where I’m learning mainly about react & Node.js. I’m looking forward to grow as a developer, (insert industry interest here). I’m a curious and commited person who believs that together we build a sustainable future, and I will keep working to build that future!
