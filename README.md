# Description
This is the repository where my journey starts. Helpful to track my progess and recent learning.

I use this as a notebook. This also helps me practice Markdown format. There is a new folder added "MoreSimpleExercises". In this folder we can find parallel exercises to the ones I'm learning at CoreCode so I can have a better grasp of the concepts we are learning simultaneously. These exercises are referenced from CodeCademy.

# My mission statement
I am Ingrid, a web software developer. I come from a background in humanities and politics. However, my first project involving technology was creating content in Social Media along with a little of graphic design basics. In my brief and recent experience with technology, I encountered this fascination for Web Development. Currently, I’m building with JavaScript and learning to script with React and Node.js at CoreCode “Software Development Fundamentals” bootcamp. I’m looking forward to growing as a developer. I’m very curious and committed in every project I involve. Nice to e-meet you!
