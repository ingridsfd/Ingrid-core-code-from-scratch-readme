### API stablishment:
/* EXERCISE 9
Intro:

    PowerUsers idea was bad. Once those users got
    extended permissions, they started bullying others
    and we lost a lot of great users.
    As a response we spent all the remaining money
    on the marketing and got even more users.
    We need to start preparing to move everything to a
    real database. For now we just do some mocks.

    The server API format was decided to be the following:

    In case of success: { status: 'success', data: RESPONSE_DATA }
    In case of error: { status: 'error', error: ERROR_MESSAGE }

    The API engineer started creating types for this API and
    quickly figured out that the amount of types needed to be
    created is too big.

Exercise:

    Remove UsersApiResponse and AdminsApiResponse types
    and use generic type ApiResponse in order to specify API
    response formats for each of the functions.

```JavaScript
export type ApiResponse<T> =
      | { status: 'success'; data: T; }
      | { status: 'error'; error: string; };

export function requestAdmins(callback: (response: ApiResponse<Admin[]>) => void) {
    callback({
        status: 'success',
        data: admins
    });
}

export function requestUsers(callback: (response: ApiResponse<User[]>) => void) {
    callback({
        status: 'success',
        data: users
    });
}

export function requestCurrentServerTime(callback: (response: ApiResponse<number>) => void) {
    callback({
        status: 'success',
        data: Date.now()
    });
}

export function requestCoffeeMachineQueueLength(callback: (response: ApiResponse<number>) => void) {
    callback({
        status: 'error',
        error: 'Numeric value has exceeded Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.'
    });
}
```
