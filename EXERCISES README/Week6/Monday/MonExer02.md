# ✅TypeScript Object Type exercise

### Exercise to define the interface:
 ```TypeScript
 /* EXERCISE 1
 Intro context for the exercise:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

*/

export interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

export const users: User[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: User) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log('Users:');
users.forEach(logPerson);
```
### Exercise to define the type of Person: User | Admin
```TypeScript
/* EXERCISE 2

Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

*/

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: Person) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

persons.forEach(logPerson);
```
### To use the **in** operator:

```TypeScript
/* EXERCISE 3
Intro:

    Since we already have some of the additional
    information about our users, it's a good idea
    to output it in a nice way.

Exercise:

    Fix type errors in logPerson function.

    logPerson function should accept both User and Admin
    and should output relevant information according to
    the input: occupation for User and role for Admin.

*/

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
];

export function logPerson(person: Person) {
    let additionalInformation: string;
    if ('role' in person) {
        additionalInformation = person.role;
    } else {
        additionalInformation = person.occupation;
    }
    console.log(` - ${person.name}, ${person.age}, ${additionalInformation}`);
}

persons.forEach(logPerson);
```
