# ✅TypeScript Object Type exercise

### Exercise to define the interface:
 ```TypeScript
 /* EXERCISE 1
 Intro context for the exercise:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

*/

export interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

export const users: User[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: User) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log('Users:');
users.forEach(logPerson);
```
### Exercise to define the type of Person: User | Admin
```TypeScript
/* EXERCISE 2

Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

*/

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: Person) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

persons.forEach(logPerson);
```
### To use the **in** operator:

```TypeScript
/* EXERCISE 3
Intro:

    Since we already have some of the additional
    information about our users, it's a good idea
    to output it in a nice way.

Exercise:

    Fix type errors in logPerson function.

    logPerson function should accept both User and Admin
    and should output relevant information according to
    the input: occupation for User and role for Admin.
*/

export function logPerson(person: Person) {
    let additionalInformation: string;
    if ('role' in person) {
        additionalInformation = person.role;
    } else {
        additionalInformation = person.occupation;
    }
    console.log(` - ${person.name}, ${person.age}, ${additionalInformation}`);
}

persons.forEach(logPerson);
```
### About the TypePredicates **is**:
```JavaScript
/* EXERCISE 4
Intro:

    As we introduced "type" to both User and Admin
    it's now easier to distinguish between them.
    Once object type checking logic was extracted
    into separate functions isUser and isAdmin -
    logPerson function got new type errors.

Exercise:

    Figure out how to help TypeScript understand types in
    this situation and apply necessary fixes.
*/

export function isAdmin(person: Person): person is Admin {
    return person.type === 'admin';
}

export function isUser(person: Person): person is User {
    return person.type === 'user';
}

export function logPerson(person: Person) {
    let additionalInformation: string = '';
    if (isAdmin(person)) {
        additionalInformation = person.role;
    }
    if (isUser(person)) {
        additionalInformation = person.occupation;
    }
    console.log(` - ${person.name}, ${person.age}, ${additionalInformation}`);
}

console.log('Admins:');
persons.filter(isAdmin).forEach(logPerson);

console.log();

console.log('Users:');
persons.filter(isUser).forEach(logPerson);
```
### Example of Utility Types and Predifined conditional types:
```JavaScript
/* EXERCISE 5
Intro:

    Time to filter the data! In order to be flexible
    we filter users using a number of criteria and
    return only those matching all of the criteria.
    We don't need Admins yet, we only filter Users.

Exercise:

    Without duplicating type structures, modify
    filterUsers function definition so that we can
    pass only those criteria which are needed,
    and not the whole User information as it is
    required now according to typing.

Higher difficulty bonus exercise:

    Exclude "type" from filter criterias.
*/
export function filterUsers(persons: Person[], criteria: Partial<Omit<User, 'type'>>): User[] {
    return persons.filter(isUser).filter((user) => {
        const criteriaKeys = Object.keys(criteria) as (keyof Omit<User, 'type'>)[];
        return criteriaKeys.every((fieldName) => {
            return user[fieldName] === criteria[fieldName];
        });
    });
}

console.log('Users of age 23:');

filterUsers(
    persons,
    {
        age: 23
    }
).forEach(logPerson);
```
TypeScript 2.8 adds several predefined conditional types to lib.d.ts:

* Exclude<T, U> — Exclude from T those types that are assignable to U.
* Extract<T, U> — Extract from T those types that are assignable to U.
* NonNullable<T> — Exclude null and undefined from T.
* ReturnType<T> — Obtain the return type of a function type.
*InstanceType<T> — Obtain the instance type of a constructor function type.

### To understand the Function Overloads - to call a function in different ways:
```JavaScript
/* EXCERSICE 6
Intro:

    Filtering requirements have grown. We need to be
    able to filter any kind of Persons.

Exercise:

    Fix typing for the filterPersons so that it can filter users
    and return User[] when personType='user' and return Admin[]
    when personType='admin'. Also filterPersons should accept
    partial User/Admin type according to the personType.
    `criteria` argument should behave according to the
    `personType` argument value. `type` field is not allowed in
    the `criteria` field.

Higher difficulty bonus exercise:

    Implement a function `getObjectKeys()` which returns more
    convenient result for any argument given, so that you don't
    need to cast it.

    let criteriaKeys = Object.keys(criteria) as (keyof User)[];
    -->
    let criteriaKeys = getObjectKeys(criteria);
*/
const getObjectKeys = <T>(obj: T) => Object.keys(obj) as (keyof T)[];

export function filterPersons(persons: Person[], personType: 'user', criteria: Partial<Omit<User, 'type'>>): User[];
export function filterPersons(persons: Person[], personType: 'admin', criteria: Partial<Omit<Admin, 'type'>>): Admin[];
export function filterPersons(persons: Person[], personType: string, criteria: Partial<Person>): Person[] {
    return persons
        .filter((person) => person.type === personType)
        .filter((person) => {
            let criteriaKeys = getObjectKeys(criteria);
            return criteriaKeys.every((fieldName) => {
                return person[fieldName] === criteria[fieldName];
            });
        });
}

export const usersOfAge23 = filterPersons(persons, 'user', { age: 23 });
export const adminsOfAge23 = filterPersons(persons, 'admin', { age: 23 });

console.log('Users of age 23:');
usersOfAge23.forEach(logPerson);

console.log();

console.log('Admins of age 23:');
adminsOfAge23.forEach(logPerson);
```
### Swap
 ```JavaScript
 /* EXERCISE 7
Intro:

    Filtering was completely removed from the project.
    It turned out that this feature was just not needed
    for the end-user and we spent a lot of time just because
    our office manager told us to do so. Next time we should
    instead listen to the product management.

    Anyway we have a new plan. CEO's friend Nick told us
    that if we randomly swap user names from time to time
    in the community, it would be very funny and the project
    would definitely succeed!

Exercise:

    Implement swap which receives 2 persons and returns them in
    the reverse order. The function itself is already
    there, actually. We just need to provide it with proper types.
    Also this function shouldn't necessarily be limited to just
    Person types, lets type it so that it works with any two types
    specified.
*/
 ```
