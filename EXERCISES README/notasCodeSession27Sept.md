A lot of apps are created with NodeJs.

As developers we can create or adapt API's to make units talk to each other.
Do the routers have API to communicate with other routers? Application that access information.

# Notes during Stand-Up

Nest Js is a framework. Allows us create apps for servers. Specially APIS. Reduces the long lines of coding. It's a good practice.
