1. [x] Watch Object-Oriented Programming - Resume video
* Procedural programming: program divided in a set of functions.
* Too much interdependence functions is not good in programming. Object Oriented Programming solves this.
* Units are objects. Variables, properties. Functions are methods.
* Encapsulation: Is where everything is grouped.The variables and functions. Reduce complexity and re-use code.
* Objects with no parameters, are better.
* Abstraction: Hide the complex. Show the essentials.
* Inheritance: Avoid redundant code.
* Polymorphism: Refactor "ugly" switch/case statements.

2. [ ] Develop typed functions by using TypeScript guided exercise, using Typescript
3. [x] Read Abstract Classes
Type 1: To add the properties as such. En este, la propiedad tiene que asignarse despues a la clase que se extiende tambiÃ©n.
Type 2: The use of 'super()' to initialize it.
5. [x] Watch Abstract Classes vs Interfaces video
La diferencia entre clases abstractas e interfaces: The main difference is what they mean semantically.
Abstract classes generalize behavior. From the general to the particular.
Interfaces standarize behavior... so we do not break existing implementations.
Question to considerate: What happens if two parents have the same behavior but we want to extend or implement, which will it have?
