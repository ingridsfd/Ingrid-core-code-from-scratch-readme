* Procedural programming: program divided in a set of functions.
* Too much interdependence functions is not good in programming. Object Oriented Programming solves this.
* Units are objects. Variables, properties. Functions are methods.
* Encapsulation: Is where everything is grouped.The variables and functions. Reduce complexity and re-use code.
* Objects with no parameters, are better.
* Abstraction: Hide the complex. Show the essentials.
* Inheritance: Avoid redundant code.
* Polymorphism: Refactor "ugly" switch/case statements.
