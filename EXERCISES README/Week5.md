1. [x] Learn about FP vs OOP
Notes: 
Functional Programming:
* Functions only: A way we can solve a problem. We have pure functions.
* No Side Effects: Events that happen within limited scope. Bugs minimized. 
* Fixed control Flow: Mapping input and output.

One kind of functions works with variables defined. The other one, has none of those variables defined.

Object Oriented Programming.
* Class: abstract blue print with attributes and methods
* Objects can pass different data while still having same or different attributes.
* Methods can change (update) the state of an object.

3. [x] Learn about Fundamental Concepts of Object Oriented Programming

An object/entity is anything that you want to store and process data about.
* Abstraction: Simplify reality. Focus on the processes relevant to the application built. Class is template to creating the object(type). Operations: behavior of the object.
* Encapsulation: Hide/Manipulation of the data and complexity of the object.
* Inheritance: Derivation of properties(sub and superclass), methods and class. Type of relationships.
* Polymorphism: The class can implement its own method in its own way. Many forms of saving the data.
