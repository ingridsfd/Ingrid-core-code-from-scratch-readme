1. [x] Learn about FP vs OOP
Notes: 
Functional Programming:
* Functions only: A way we can solve a problem. We have pure functions.
* No Side Effects: Events that happen within limited scope. Bugs minimized. 
* Fixed control Flow: Mapping input and output.

One kind of functions works with variables defined. The other one, has none of those variables defined.

Object Oriented Programming.
* Class: abstract blue print with attributes and methods
* Objects can pass different data while still having same or different attributes.
* Methods can change (update) the state of an object.
